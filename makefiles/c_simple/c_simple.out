C_SIMPLE
  A simple C program to demonstrate
  the use of makefiles.

  Estimate the integral from 0 to 1000, of
  F(T) = (4+T/365+1/2 sin(pi*T/91)) * (2+exp(-sin(2*pi*T)))
  a function which models daily power consumption.

  quad = midpoint ( a, b, f, int_num )
  estimates the integral using the midpoint rule.

  f ( t )
  evaluates the integrand.
