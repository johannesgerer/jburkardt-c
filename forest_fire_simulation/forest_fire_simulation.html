    <p>
      <b>FOREST_FIRE_SIMULATION</b>
      is a C program which
      simulates forest fires, by Michael Creutz.
    </p>

    <p>
      The program simulates a forest in which fires and regrowth occur, using
      X Windows to display the current status of the forest.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>FOREST_FIRE_SIMULATION</b> models forest fires.  On each site of a
      lattice is either nothing, a tree, or a fire.  In one time step a fire
      spreads to adjacent trees and leaves an empty space.  Trees are born 
      in a random manner with a probability of approximately 1/32 per time step.
      If no fires are active, one is started at a random location.
      Fires can also be started with the mouse button.
    </p>

    <p>
      An Amiga version of this program  was published in the December 1993
      issue of "JUMPDISK".
