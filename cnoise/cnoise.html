      CNOISE <br> 1/F^alpha Power Law Noise Generation
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>CNOISE</b>
      is a C library which
      generates sequences that simulate 1/f^alpha power law noise.  This includes 
      white noise (alpha = 0), pink noise (alpha = 1) and red or Brownian noise (alpha = 2),
      as well as noise for values of alpha between 0 and 2,
      by Miroslav Stoyanov.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>CNOISE</b> is based in part on an algorithm by Kasdin,
      as cited in the references.
    </p>

    <p>
      Kasdin's implementation referenced a number of functions from the
      Numerical Recipes library (FOUR1, FREE_VECTOR, GASDEV, RAN1,
      REALFT, VECTOR).  Numerical Recipes is a proprietary library
      whose components cannot be freely distributed.  The implementation
      given here relies instead on the free source library "GSL"
      (the GNU Scientific Library).  Thus anyone can build the
      code without requiring access to restricted or proprietary software.
    </p>

    <p>
      Other features of this version of the algorithm include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          real arithmetic is done in double precision;
        </li>
        <li>
          the GSL Fast Fourier Transform functions do not require
          that the input data be a power of 2 in size;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Versions of the algorithm are implemented which generate a vector x
      of size N with a 1/f^alpha frequency distribution, with three choices
      for the underlying distribution of the white noise vector:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>cnoise_generate_colored_noise_uniform()</b>,
          a uniform distribution on (-range,+range);
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>cnoise_generate_colored_noise()</b>,
          a Gaussian distribution with mean 0, standard deviation std;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>cnoise_generate_colored_noise_truncated()</b>,
          a Gaussian distribution with mean 0,
          standard deviation std, truncated to (-range,range).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that this code was updated on 10 June 2011.  Previously, the random
      number generator was used in such a way that it was possible to return a value
      which was exactly zero.  Because the logarithm of these numbers was used in
      the generation of the noise vectors, this meant that occasionally a floating
      point exception would be triggered.  A minor adjustment to the algorithm
      has removed this problem.
