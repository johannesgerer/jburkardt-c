      COMPLEX_NUMBERS <br> Complex Numbers in C Programming
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>COMPLEX_NUMBERS</b> is a C program which
      demonstrates very briefly some of the features of using complex
      numbers in a C program.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first issue is how to declare a complex variable, including
      the choice of single precision or double precision, whether
      the variable is a scalar, vector, or array, and whether the variable
      is initialized with a value, or assigned one.
    </p>

    <p>
      A second issue concerns the question of how a complex variable is
      to be printed out.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another issue concerns how a complex variable is to operated on
      by the arithmetic operators of addition, subtraction, multiplication,
      division, and exponentiation.
    </p>

    <p>
      The language also provides a number of intrinsic functions that
      can be applied to a complex variable.  The names of these functions
      can sometimes be easy to forget.  Moreover, it is occasionally true
      that there may be a selection of functions with similar names
      (say, "exp", "cexp" and "dcexp") which may or may not produce the
      desired results.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another issue concerns the details of double precision calculation.
      Even a single accidental use of a single precision function name
      in a double precision computation can result in the loss of half
      the digits of accuracy.  Thus, it sometimes really matters whether
      you use "cmplx" or "dcmplx" to assign values to a double precision
      complex variable.
    </p>

    <p>
      An unusual feature of the implementation of complex numbers in
      C is that a complex number can be defined by a statement like
      <blockquote>
        z = a + b * I;
      </blockquote>
      where <b>I</b> is predefined; but <b>I</b> is actually implemented
      via a macro, and is not a numeric value.  It needs to be multiplied
      by a number to be meaningful (this is how it determines the precision
      it will use, for instance).  So you cannot set the imaginary unit by
      <blockquote>
        a = I;
      </blockquote>
      Instead, you would have to write
      <blockquote>
        a = 1 * I;
      </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>
      Another issue concerns the mistakes that can be made, which will
      evoke no warning from the compiler, but which will produce incorrect
      results.  Here I am thinking, in particular, of the fact that if
      <b>z</b> is float complex or double complex, you should compute
      its exponential with the expression <b>cexp(z)</b>; however, no
      compiler warning will occur if you use the expression <b>exp(z)</b>;
      however, these two expressions are not equivalent, and will
      yield different results.
