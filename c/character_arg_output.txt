CHARACTER_ARG:
  Demonstrate how a C function can return character data
  through the argument list.

  Our main program declares a character point:
    char *name;
  and then calls function fred() with the ADDRESS of the pointer:
    fred ( &name );
  Function fred receives its argument as
    void fred ( char **name )
  It allocates memory for *name:
    *name = ( char * ) malloc ( 12 * sizeof ( char ) );
  It sets a value to *name:
    strcpy ( *name, "ob_data.txt" );
  The main program now has a string stored in name:
    printf ( "String returned from fred: \n", name )

  The value of name is now = "ob_data.txt"

CHARACTER_ARG:
  Normal end of execution.
